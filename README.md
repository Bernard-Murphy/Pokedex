# Pokedex

### [Live Site](https://bernardmurphy.net/pokedex)

The Pokedex app utilizes data from Bulbapedia and the Pokemon API to give Pokemon enthusiasts everything they need to know about any Pokemon.

When a user submits the form, a profile is built of the Pokemon that they selected. This includes that Pokemon's sprites (regular and shiny), stats, types, number, and abilities. A user who would like to get a detailed explanation of some of these attributes, such as the Pokemon's type or ability, can click on one of these things and a new tab will open and the user will be shown the Bulbapedia article on said attribute. If the user clicks "Check Moves", the app will take a few seconds to draw informations about all of the moves that the Pokemon can learn from all sources. 

Note: The Pokemon API randomly 404s sometimes.
